<h1>EARLY EDUCATION</h1><hr>
<p>Daniel Jacob Radcliffe was born on 23 July 1989 at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in the Hammersmith district of London, the only child of Alan George Radcliffe and Marcia Jeannine Gresham (née Jacobson). His mother, who is Jewish, was born in South Africa and brought up in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex.His father was raised in Banbridge, County Down, Northern Ireland, in a "very working-class" Protestant family.Radcliffe's maternal ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, Germany, Poland and Russia. In 2019, Radcliffe explored both sides of his family history in series sixteen of BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?. Radcliffe's parents had both acted as children. His father is a literary agent, and his mother is a casting agent who has been involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Walk Away and I Stumble.<br>
As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted to not being a very good student, considering school useless and finding the work "really difficult". He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience.</p>
<h1>PERSONAL LIFE</h1><hr>
<p>Radcliffe owns a home in the West Village neighbourhood of Manhattan in New York City, and divides his time between New York and Fulham, London. He has been in a relationship with actress Erin Darke, whom he met on the set of Kill Your Darlings, since 2012.

On 13 April 2006 his portrait, drawn by Stuart Pearson Wright, was unveiled as part of a new exhibition opening at the National Theatre; it was then moved to the National Portrait Gallery. In 2008, Radcliffe revealed that he has a mild form of the neurological disorder developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia). The motor skill disorder sometimes prevents him from doing simple activities, such as writing or tying his own shoelaces. "I was having a hard time at school, in terms of being crap at everything, with no discernible talent", Radcliffe commented. In November 2007, Radcliffe published several poems under the pen name Jacob Gershon—a combination of his middle name and the Jewish version of his mother's maiden name Gresham—in Rubbish, an underground fashion magazine.

Radcliffe has expressed his fondness for rap music and admitted to having "an obsession with memorising complicated, lyrically intricate and fast songs." He rapped Blackalicious' 1999 hit "Alphabet Aerobics" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on 28 October 2014.</p>
